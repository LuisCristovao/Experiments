FullStack Challenge


Need to create a DB with of function like f2=f1^2 

The computations are done on the back end

/ADMIN
user can create edit delete function at will.

/
user insert function on input field and press enter or calculate to calculate the answer.

Need possibly to create a sqlite DB pthon or just a json file???

{f1:f2*2},{f2:4}

first focus on backend meaning no good looking UX
Then improve UX.

But can use from beginning bootstrap.

Dificulties: 
	make calculations
	detect a non valid function, for instance, f1=f2 and f2=f1
	
	
	
DB
Table Functions:				or simply a JSON
	String: Name,
	String: function
