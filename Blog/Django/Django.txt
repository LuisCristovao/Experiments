	There is also a terminal console to make pip install and so on....
	It is very usefull to use this terminal!


# Django beginning:

	* To create django project use the following command in the terminal: **django-admin startproject <project Name>**
	* This will create a folder with project name
	* The project will have the structure of image: <imgs/Django_Project_Folder_Organization.png>
	* we will work mustly in **urls** and **settings**
	* to **RUN** the server run the manage.py on terminal like :**python manage.py runserver** #on the file working directory

# Django first application:

		## Django request response cycle:

		## Create URL
		
			* DJango uses MVC, like all.
			* To create an url go to urls.py and write the following:
				
				'''
				import django.views as views
				
				urlpatterns = [
					path("hello/",views.hello),
					path('admin/', admin.site.urls)
				]
				'''
			* As you can see in the previous code you need to create a new python file named **views.py** (of course it could be other), inside project folder (the same that as urls.py) 
			* In views.py you can create all functions used for each path
			* for the first view example see this code from views.py:
				
				'''
				from django.http import HttpResponse

				def hello(request):
					return HttpResponse("Hello World")
				'''
			* Basically it will receives a request from client(browser) and responds with a string in this case.
