First question: Find the most bought product(quantity) in DB
we need to search in two tables
In Products(p) and in OrderDetails(o)

We need a query like this: select ProductID,ProductName,Price, Total Quantity
the first 3 columns can be found in Products table the quantity in OrderDetails

let us do this for a single selected product:

SELECT p.ProductID,p.ProductName,p.Price,SUM(o.Quantity) as "Total Quantity"
FROM [Products] as p
INNER JOIN OrderDetails as o
on o.ProductID=p.ProductID
where o.ProductID=2 

Result:
->ProductID,ProductName,Price,Total Quantity
->	  2	   ,   Chang   ,  19 ,    341

Now let us see this for all products and make a top 10:

SELECT p.ProductID,p.ProductName,p.Price,SUM(o.Quantity) as "Total Quantity"
FROM [Products] as p
INNER JOIN OrderDetails as o
on o.ProductID=p.ProductID
group by p.ProductID --	it can be o.ProductID it will have same result

This will show all products and the quantity of times they were bought
to make a top 10:

SELECT p.ProductID,p.ProductName,p.Price,SUM(o.Quantity) as "Total Quantity"
FROM [Products] as p
INNER JOIN OrderDetails as o
on o.ProductID=p.ProductID
group by p.ProductID	
order by [Total Quantity] desc 
limit 10

result:
=> the most bought product is 31 - "Gorgonzola Telino" with 458 boughts

//______________________________________________________________________________________
Now let us see the product that gave the biggest revenue?
what columns we need the previous ones  plus the multiplication of (Total Quantity)*Price

So this is very similar to previous so:

SELECT p.ProductID,p.ProductName,p.Price,SUM(o.Quantity) as "Total Quantity",(SUM(o.Quantity)*p.Price) as "Total Profit"
FROM [Products] as p
INNER JOIN OrderDetails as o
on o.ProductID=p.ProductID
group by p.ProductID	
order by [Total Profit] desc 
limit 10

result:
=>The most profitable product is different from the most sold and it is :
=>Côte de Blaye that costs 263.5, sold 239 units, and as profit of 62976.5


"Gorgonzola Telino" dont even appears in the top 10

//_________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now let us ask this question who was the company that sold more and or obtain more profit.
let us see the last one what company obtain more profit

We know that Products table as SupplierID we know that OrderDetails has the quantity sold of each product.
We need to use these 3 tables (Products,OrderDetails, Suppliers). what we need to see?

SupplierID,SupplierName,COuntry, Total Profit= (Qunatity of products sold times the price)

first lets select the products sold by single company, for instance supplierID=1.

SELECT s.SupplierID,s.SupplierName,s.Country,p.ProductID,p.ProductName,p.Price 
FROM [Suppliers] as s
inner join Products as p
on s.SupplierID=p.SupplierID
where s.SupplierID=1

Now let us see the quantity of each product sold by this company

SELECT  s.SupplierID,s.SupplierName,s.Country,p.ProductID,p.ProductName,p.Price,sum(o.Quantity) as "Total Sold"
FROM [Suppliers] as s
inner join Products as p
on s.SupplierID=p.SupplierID
inner join OrderDetails as o
on p.ProductID=o.ProductID
where s.SupplierID=1
group by p.ProductID

Now the profit for each product company 1 sells

SELECT  s.SupplierID,s.SupplierName,s.Country,p.ProductID,p.ProductName,p.Price,sum(o.Quantity) as "Total Sold",(p.Price*sum(o.Quantity)) as "Profit"
FROM [Suppliers] as s
inner join Products as p
on s.SupplierID=p.SupplierID
inner join OrderDetails as o
on p.ProductID=o.ProductID
where s.SupplierID=1
group by p.ProductID
order by Profit desc

With this query is possible to see that the most profitable product is productID=2

Now yes we can measure the most profitable company

For instance profit of company 1:

SELECT  s.SupplierID,s.SupplierName,s.Country,(p.Price*sum(o.Quantity)) as "Profit"
FROM [Suppliers] as s
inner join Products as p
on s.SupplierID=p.SupplierID
inner join OrderDetails as o
on p.ProductID=o.ProductID
where s.SupplierID=1

result: 11020 está errado!!!!!!!!!!! n funciona isto
