## Intro  
  

We have on an original page the following structure:  
  

* index.html -> is the first page  
* on **Site** folder we have the images, video, pages, blog, CSS, js... **folders**  
  

Trying to copy this structure, with just one template page where the rest HTML is copied in to.  
  
  

## Thinking Solution  
  

For instance, let the **index.html** be the **template**. It has a header with the burger menu.  
The template is basically just this because this will appear on any page so that the user has access to the menu all the time. In  the case of the projects page where there is a footer, this is still not a problem.
